# Intermediate Book Store Indexes

In this project, we’ll look at how adding more complex indexes can help
(or hurt!) your database. Let’s imagine we are running an online book
store and need to keep track of what books we offer. We’ll be working
with a database of three tables. The `books` table is created from the
[top selling books of all
time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books). The
`customers` and `orders` tables are randomly generated.

As a note, this project will most likely run slower for you than most
other projects in codeacademy. In order to see the benefits of an index,
you need a large database. We tried to make the database as small as
possible but still large enough to get a benefit of creating good
indexes.

If you have trouble viewing information on any of the panels remember
you can adjust the size of any of the windows by dragging on their
edges.
